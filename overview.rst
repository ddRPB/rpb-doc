Overview of RPB
===============

The RPB platform is a web-based solution for exchanging and sharing medical cancer treatment research data in order to allow multi-centric studies. The idea is to deliver a study management and electronic data capture system with special extensions dedicated to safe upload of medical DICOM files.
