Enroll New Study Subjects
=========================

.. note::
	ROLE_PID_NEW ROLE_EDC_SUBMIT

Before the new subject can be enrolled to the study, it is usually necessary to generate PID for this subject (When PID generator aka patient identity management system is used), see Fig. 8. The user is asked to fill some basic identity data. The optional identity data (like place or residence, ZIP code and birthname) are recommended if they are available for data entry personnel in order to guarantee uniqueness of generated PID. After data is provided the click on button Generate will trigger the process. The algorithm is trying to figure out if the patient with provided identity data is already in registered in the system (return his PID) or if it is new patient (generate new PID). After PID is provided the second Submit button is responsible for triggering the enrolment of the subject to the study.
