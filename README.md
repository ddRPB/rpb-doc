RPB documentation is hosted at [rpb-doc.readthedocs.io](http://rpb-doc.readthedocs.io "ddRPB platform reference documentation")

## Build

Sphinx documentation generator is required in order to build a copy of documentation locally. Make sure that you have Python and Sphinx installed on your system before trying to build the  documentation.
