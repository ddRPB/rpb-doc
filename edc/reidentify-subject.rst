Re-identify Study Subject
=========================

.. note::
	ROLE_REIDENTIFY permission is needed to allow subject re-identification.

if RPB PID generator was used to pseudonymise the participating subject it is possible to re-identify the subject
given the user has the necessary rights.

Once the patient is successfully registered and enrolled into the study it is easy to get get back his identity details when necessary (according to PID), see Fig. 8. The identity information stored in patient identity management system is retrieved when the user click on Reidentify button.
