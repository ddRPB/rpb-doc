Tips for preparing comma separated value (CSV) tabular files for import:

- Make sure that you use one date format per column (during mapping the date format string is specified)

- For integer coded cells make sure to use format of number general (1.00 is not the same as 1 when we are talking about codification)

- Make sure that all headers have values (if coulmn header is empty, there is no way for program to handle it)

Helper functions (LibreOffice - Calc):
